# Master-Code-Of-Plotting-Using-Matplotlib
It is coded in python using matplotlib.pyplot.
In this program, I have used matplotlib.pyplot and numpy. You can install matplotlib using pip in Scripts folder of your Python IDLE or in the folder where you have installed pip.
In the code the program first asks the user what does he wants to print.
According to the response, the required code is run which takes the required input to make the required chart or graph.
You have to give inputs for x-axis and y-axis if you are plotting a bar or a line graph.
For pie you can give it values and labels.
Legend is always printed.
Hope you liked this:)
